# Exploratory Data Analysis 

A separate analysis was completed on 2020 data first, and then on data for thears from 2012 - 2020. 

This was intentionally done to use 2020 as a benchmark for the analysis overall. 

## Data focus

1) years 2012-2020 
2) Only reporting Institutions 
3) Only Institutions who are degree granting and offer Undergraduate degrees
4) Territorially delimited focus
