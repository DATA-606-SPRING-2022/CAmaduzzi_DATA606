# Interim data files 

I am currently still working on the data cleansing. 

I have focused initially on identifying the core Higher Education Institutions that 
1) are degree offering institutions
2) are primarily focused on undergraduate programs (even if offering also higher level programs) 
3) are reporting institutions in the year 2020

Once identified this sub-group of institutions, I will use the HEIs IDs to extract the information about them throughout the reporting years of focus (2008-2020)

I am not yet ready at this time to uplaod cleansed data files. (as of Feb 20/2022)
