# Data Sources

The data files I am using are available at this web page.

I will focus on the years from 2008 through 2020. 

The decision to focus on these years is based on the consideration that these were the years since the Obama administration took office and, since the data is somewhat more recent, I am hoping that there will be less of an issue with data consistency across the years. 

Initial review of the data files however, has already highlighted a few issues (more on that later). 

Important to note: I will use any revised files that are updated to this web page since this will guarantee that the most recent data available has been used and the most accurate data available is being used.
